cu is a simple customer relationship management using YAML.

Basically, cu provides some command line tools to work with customer
data stored in plain YAML files.

Tools provided:

- cu-mail: Generate letters (using LaTeX) or send mails to
  customers. You provide the templates and customer files, cu does the
  rest.
- cu-search: Search customers based on their data.


cu is still under development and in alpha state.
